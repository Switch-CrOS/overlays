# Change the following (commented out) number to the next prime number
# when you change lakitu_kernel_config_4_4.  This workaround will force the
# ChromeOS CQ to uprev sys-kernel/lakitu-kernel-4_4 ebuild and pick up the
# configuration changes.  In absence of this workaround the config changes
# would not be picked up unless there was a code change in kernel source tree.
#
# NOTE: There's nothing magic keeping this number prime but you just need to
# make _any_ change to this file.  ...so why not keep it prime?
#
# The coolest prime number is: 11
